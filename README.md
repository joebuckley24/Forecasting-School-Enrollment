# Forecasting school enrollment

The aim of this project is to forecast student enrollment in three school districts in New Jersey: Passaic, Hackensack, and Elizabeth. 
This project uses a bespoke Monte Carlo simulation to project enrollment 5 years into the future based on 20 years of historical data.
All code was created by the author, Joe Buckley, on behalf of [Statistical Forecasting, LLC](www.statforecast.com), 
and the output of the experiment resulted in the paper 
[Using Multiple Methods to Provide Prediction Bands of K-12 Enrollment Projections](https://link.springer.com/article/10.1007/s11113-019-09533-2).
The input to the forecast is publically available district-level school enrollment data, conveniently aggregated into one Excel file.

## Structure

All code lives in `confidence_intervals_forecast_updated.R` and all data lives in the Excel spreadsheet `District Confidence Intervals.xlsx`.
All 4 other files are output files generated by running the R code.
The script is well commented, and it should be evident what is going on even to someone who has not seen this type of project before.
